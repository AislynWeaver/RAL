<h2>About</h2>
<p>
RAL is a text-only message board / forum. It is written by
<a href="https://prettyboytellem.com">Prettyboy Yumi</a>.

First, you may notice that there are a number of different boards which have
a single focus. These boards are called <em>Continuities</em> because unlike
boards, posts are never archived and threads are never locked: conversation
is continuous, so it is called a <em>Continuity</em>; each has its own focus. The
focus is a glimpse into realm of truth that is afforded by the Continuity.
However, the truth is not freely-given and is hardly objective. Therefore,
you should post to expose this truth. In turn, posting could not exist
without this focusing truth so please respect it.

RAL is named for the beautiful city of oaks in North Carolina, Raleigh.
