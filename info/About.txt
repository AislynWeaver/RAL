<h2>About</h2>
<article><p>
RAL is a text-only message board / forum. It is written solely by
<a href="https://prettyboytellem.com">Prettyboy Yumi</a> who is enigmatic as he
is charming (according to a popular vote once held).
</p><p>
When you enter RAL, you'll notice there are many different places you can
visit. These are called <em>continuities</em>; each has its own focus. The
focus is a glimpse into realm of truth that is afforded by the continuity.
However, the truth is not freely-given and is hardly objective. Therefore,
people should post to expose this truth. In turn, posting could not exist
without this focusing truth so please respect it.
</p><p>
At the end of every calendar year (the solar, not lunar (nor governmental)
calendar) all posts are raptured and archived for you to enjoy. They are
available to download in a variety of formats. Alternatively,
you may order the <em>Coffee Table</em> volume (details coming soon).

For the curious, RAL is named for the beautiful city of oaks in North
Carolina which was my home for the time I wrote this site.
