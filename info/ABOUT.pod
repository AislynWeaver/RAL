=head1 Summary

RAL is a text-only message board / forum. It provides a totally anonymous
discussion space on the internet; RAL is often called a neo-forum because it
takes inspiration from and improves upon the classic forum model.

When you enter RAL, you'll notice there are many different places you can
visit. These are called I<continuities>; each has its own focus. When a
continuity's focus is completed you unlock the C<VIRTUAL WORLD>.

and he would love to hear if you enjoy using the site! The source code is

For the curious, RAL is so named for the beautiful city of oaks in North
Carolina which was my home for the time I wrote this site.

I hope you'll come to enjoy your time on RAL!
